# Students_Marks_Prediction_and_Improvement
This project focuses on predicting students' academic performance (pass or fail) based on their attributes, such as attendance, class test scores, and total assignments. It uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm and incorporates Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to handle imbalanced datasets.
